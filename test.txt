CSS:
/* Target scrollbar thumb */
.custom-scrollbar .simplebar-scrollbar::before {
    content: '';
    background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(232,198,135,1) 0%, rgba(193,153,94,1) 100%);
    border-radius: 6px;
    opacity: 1 !important;
}
  
/* Move vertical scrollbar 50px to the right */
.custom-scrollbar .simplebar-track.simplebar-vertical {
    right: -50px !important;
    width: 6px !important;
}
  
/* Hide horizontal scrollbar */
.custom-scrollbar .simplebar-track.simplebar-horizontal {
    display: none !important;
}


this works, however, I need to increase the width of the scrollbar, set the track color to bg-darkgrey and make the scrollbar clickable and draggable
